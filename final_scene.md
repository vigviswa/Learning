Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main
temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Leia is
dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.
She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He
winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who
is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled
troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo
beeps with happiness.
