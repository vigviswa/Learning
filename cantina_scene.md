This is a change I made on GitHub.

**[GREEDO]**  Going somewhere, Solo?

**[HAN]**  Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I
was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

**[GREEDO]**  It's too late. You should have paid
him when you had the chance. Jabba's
put a price on your head, so large
that every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you. I'm lucky I
found you first.

**[HAN]**  Yeah, but this time I got the money.

**[GREEDO]**  If you give it to me, I might forget
I found you.

**[HAN]**  I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

**[GREEDO]**  Jabba's through with you. He has no
time for smugglers who drop their
shipments at the first sign of an
Imperial cruiser.

**[HAN]**  Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you
think I had a choice?

**[GREEDO]**  You can tell that to Jabba. He may
only take your ship.

**[HAN]**  Over my dead body.

**[GREEDO]**  That's the idea. I've been looking
forward to killing you for a long
time.

**[HAN]**  Yes, I'll bet you have.



**[HAN]**  Sorry about the mess.
